# express-react-webpack-boilerplate
boilerplate with express, react and webpack which has SSR for react in express

### This is just to be used as a boilerplate and as a learning experiment

This achieves to have react server side rendered with express.

You can use scss, adding them in the .hydrate files, which are just used in the client, to hydrate the component rendered in the server.

Its `just an experiment` for myself to learn how webpack and babel work together, and mix them with reactJS and expressJS.
